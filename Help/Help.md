### Hazel Rules

Drag files to this guy and he’ll add @2x or @3x to the end of the filename.
Hi, I’ll remove @2x or @3x from your filenames, sir.

### Photoshop Scripts
Some amazing Photoshop scripts that will change your life for the better. Scale Patterns to 100% resets all patterns to 100% scale. The Scale Mask Feather scripts scale mask feathering by 33.3%, 50%, 66.6%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400% or a value of your choosing. These are handy when you scale your documents. Place in your /Adobe Photoshop CC 2014/Presets/Scripts/ folder and restart Photoshop for the scripts to appear in Scripts under the File menu.
