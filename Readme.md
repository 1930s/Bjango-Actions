Some awesome Photoshop Actions, Photoshop Scripts and Automator Workflows for iOS app and icon designers. For a full list of what the Photoshop Actions and Workflows do, please visit [bjango.com/articles/actions/](http://bjango.com/articles/actions/)

-----------------------------

### Bjango Actions.atn
The full set of Photoshop Actions. The Scale by 200% and Scale by 50% Actions also reset pattern scales, using the [Scale Patterns to 100% script](http://bjango.com/articles/scalepatternsto100/) and scale mask feathering, using the Scale Mask Feather by 200% and Scale Mask Feather by 50% scripts. You’ll need to install the scripts for these to work.

### Bjango Actions without Scripts.atn
The full set of Photoshop Actions, with scripts removed.

### Workflows/Add @2x
Drag files to this guy and he’ll add @2x to the end of the filename.

### Workflows/Remove @2x
Hi, I’ll remove @2x from your filenames, sir.

### Workflows/Rename
Need to change a file’s name? Welcome to the Filename Protection Program.

### Bjango Tools
A Photoshop panel that includes the most frequently used tools for interface and icon designers, spread out for quick access, plus buttons for turning pixel snapping on and off. Please note that you’ll need to have Bjango Actions 1.4 installed for the buttons to work. To install the Bjango Tools panel, copy the entire Bjango Tools folder to your Plug-ins/Panels/ folder and restart Photoshop. The panel can be opened by choosing Window → Extensions → Bjango Tools.

### Other/Bjango Actions (Old).atn
Old and outdated Photoshop Actions. Might be handy if you’re using Photoshop CS5 or earlier.

### Other/Scaling with and without scripts.gif
An animated demonstration of the benefit of the scripts. The animation is choreographed to Woman Friend by Chromeo (music not actually included, so you’ll have to hum it). 

### Scripts
Some amazing Photoshop scripts that will change your life for the better. Scale Patterns to 100% resets all patterns to 100% scale. The Scale Mask Feather scripts scale mask feathering by 50%, 66.6%, 150%, 200% or a value of your choosing. These are handy when you scale your documents. Place in your /Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Scripts/ folder and restart Photoshop for the scripts to appear in Scripts under the File menu. **If you’re using the Bjango Actions.atn file, you must have these installed.**
