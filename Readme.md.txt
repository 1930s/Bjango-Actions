Some awesome Photoshop Actions, Photoshop Scripts and Automator Workflows for iOS app and icon designers. For a full list of what the Photoshop Actions and Workflows do, please visit [bjango.com/articles/actions/](http://bjango.com/articles/actions/)

### Bjango Actions.atn
The full set of Photoshop Actions. The default set.

### Bjango Actions with scripts.atn
The full set of Photoshop Actions. Scaling Actions also resets pattern scales, using the Scale Patterns to 100% script (http://bjango.com/articles/scalepatternsto100/), and scales mask feathering, using the Scale Mask Feather by 200% and Scale Mask Feather by 50% scripts. You'll need to install the scripts for these to work.

### Other Actions/Bjango Actions (Old).atn
Old and outdated Photoshop Actions. Might be handy if you're using Photoshop CS5 or earlier.

### Workflows/Add @2x
Drag files to this guy and he'll add @2x to the end of the filename.

### Workflows/Remove @2x
Hi, I'll remove @2x from your filenames, sir.

### Workflows/Rename
Need to change a file's name? Welcome to the Filename Protection Program.

### Bjango Tools
A Photoshop panel that includes the most frequently used tools for interface and icon designers, spread out for quick access, plus buttons for turning pixel snapping on and off. Please note that you'll need to have Bjango Actions 1.4 installed for the buttons to work. To install the Bjango Tools panel, copy the entire Bjango Tools folder to your Plug-ins/Panels/ folder and restart Photoshop. The panel can be opened by choosing Window → Extensions → Bjango Tools.
