** Other Actions/Bjango Actions with pattern scale.atn **
The full set of Photoshop Actions. Scaling Actions also reset pattern scales, using the Scale Patterns to 100% script (http://bjango.com/articles/scalepatternsto100/). You'll need to install the Scale Patterns to 100% script for these to work.

** Workflows/Add @2x **
Drag files to this guy and he'll add @2x to the end of the filename.
** Workflows/Remove @2x **
Hi, I'll remove @2x from your filenames, sir.
** Workflows/Rename **

** Bjango Tools **
A Photoshop panel that includes the most frequently used tools for interface and icon designers, spread out for quick access, plus buttons for turning pixel snapping on and off. Please note that you'll need to have Bjango Actions 1.4 installed for the buttons to work. To install the Bjango Tools panel, copy the entire Bjango Tools folder to your Plug-ins/Panels/ folder and restart Photoshop. The panel can be opened by choosing Window → Extensions → Bjango Tools.
